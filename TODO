* Make /s modifier work (RT #67192)
  As I mention in the ticket if this is done by passing the stringified form
  into RE2 we stop needing the forked version of RE2 due to the /m issue too.
* Fix UTF-8 support
* '-strict' mode (no fallback to Perl RE)
** Need to log errors correctly if in strict mode (i.e. as exceptions)
* Support more options
** never_nl could be useful for cpangrep optimisations
* Support RE2::Set functionality
  i.e. a Regexp::RE2::Set class that can have RE2 regexps added into it
  then either a match method or maybe overload ~~?
* Improve tests
** See if t/re/re_tests from Perl can be used.
** Improve performance comparisons
   See maybe https://github.com/axiak/pyre2/blob/master/tests/performance.py
* Make -max_mem properly scoped as a pragma should be
